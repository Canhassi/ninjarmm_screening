* Cover letter

I am a Software Developer with 10+ years of C/C++ development experience. I have developed throughout my career solutions for the leading operating systems: Windows, Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS. As a C/C++ developer I have written low level code for several hardware devices, from retail store equipment to cryptographic devices. I would certainly benefit from including this experience in my curriculum.

I got my degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos, one of the top 10 universities in Brazil according to several publications, such as QS World University Rankings. I started my career as Data Administrator, but after two years, I decided to migrate to Software
Development. My previous background sometimes gives me insights I would not have if I did not have that position as Data Administrator. Furthermore, I have worked later with software that handled millions of records, and my previous experience helped me in writing efficient PL/SQL routines to communicate with databases.

In applying for this position, I got acquainted with NinjaOne for the first time, and I am very impressed knowing the platform is used in more than 83 countries. Working on a solution present in over 100 countries, I am aware of how challenging it can be to customize a system considering so
many different laws, needs, languages, etc. However, it is also exciting because it is an opportunity to know diverse people and cultures. For this reason, I think NinjaOne would be the perfect fit for my first experience in an international company, and I am also sure that I can contribute with my development experience.

Finally, I wish to thank you for the opportunity and your attention. I am very excited about this position and eager for new updates.

Best regards,
Eduardo Canhassi
